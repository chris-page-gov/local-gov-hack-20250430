# 🏙️ Local Gov Hack: Challenges

## 🎯 Challenge Areas

The hackathon is focused on addressing four key problem statements in planning and infrastructure:

1. **🏘️ Housing Demand Forecasting**: The planning system struggles to meet the demand for new housing and anticipate future demand. There is an opportunity to develop predictive models that can integrate population trends, migration patterns, and economic indicators to improve forecasting and support data-driven decision-making in housing supply needs.

2. **⚙️ Planning Process Automation**: The planning system is hindered by manual, time-consuming processes. Planning officers find it difficult to assess applications quickly—especially complex ones. There is an opportunity for automation and AI augmentation to streamline planning application reviews, document processing, and predictive maintenance.

3. **👥 Public Engagement in Planning**: When engaging the public in planning processes, it's often limited and ineffective. There's an opportunity to demonstrate how meaningful engagement with the planning system positively impacts communities and spaces by translating planning language and visions into human terms.

4. **🔄 Infrastructure & Housing Balance**: Policy makers across the UK face a complex challenge: how to plan for new homes while balancing infrastructure constraints like water, transport, digital telecoms and energy. Understanding how many homes can be delivered by place before hitting infrastructure limits is a moving target.


## 💡 Hot Tips for Success

- **🔍 Start with the problem, not the technology.** First understand the real challenges local governments face, then determine which datasets or technical solutions to apply. The most effective projects clearly identify and address high-impact problems.

- **🧠 Leverage collective knowledge.** Consult teammates, other participants, and domain experts to rapidly understand key challenges, pain points, and opportunities. The room likely contains expertise that can accelerate your learning.

- **💫 Seek inspiration everywhere.** Browse the available [datasets](./datasets.md) and consider creative combinations that yield meaningful insights. Explore [existing projects](./inspiration.md), available [tools](./tools.md), and engage with fellow participants for fresh perspectives.

- **👥 Put users at the center.** Design with the specific needs and technical capabilities of your end users in mind—whether they're planning officers, policy makers, or community members.

- **🏗️ Design for practical implementation.** Develop solutions that local governments could realistically adopt, accounting for budget limitations, integration with existing systems, and staff capabilities.

- **🤝 Embrace multidisciplinary collaboration.** Winning teams typically blend technical expertise with domain knowledge in planning, policy development, and community engagement.
